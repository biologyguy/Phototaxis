## Evolving a preference for light

This simple simulator creates 1000 'worms' on a 100x100 2D surface. Each worm can move forward and backward,
 turn left and right, and stop moving, and switching among these states is controlled by a Markovian transition
 matrix (transition probabilities are set randomly when initiated).
